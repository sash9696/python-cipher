# Python Operators


# Arithmetic Operators

# print(10+20) #addition

# print(20-10) #substraction

# print(10*20) #multiplication

# print(20/10) #division

# print(20%10) #Modulus

# print(15 // 2) #floor division  7.5 but ith rounds the result to the nearest whole number

print(15 // 4)



x = 2 
y = 5


print(x ** y) #//exponential same as 2*2*2



# Assignment Operators

a = 20

# a += 5
# a -= 5
# a *= 5
# a /= 5

# a %= 5 # same as a = a % 5

# a //=3 # a = a // 3

a **= 2 # a = a**2 i.e 20*20


print(a)


# Comparison

print(3 == 4) #Equal

print(3 != 4) #Not equal

print (3>4) #greater than

print (3<4)  #less than

print (3>=4) #greater than equal

print (3<=4)  #less than equal

# Logical Operators

x = 2

# print(x < 5 and x < 8) #Return True if both the statements are true
# print(x < 5 and x > 8)

# print(x < 5 or x > 8) #Return True, if anyone of the condition is met

# print(x > 3 or x > 10)


print(not(x < 5 and x < 8)) #reverses the result for exa -> if the result is true it will retuen false and vice versa
