# Operators precedence

# mutliplication has a higher precedence over substraction
# print(10 - 4 * 2)

# paranthesis () has higher precedence over multiplication
# print((10 - 4) * 2)

# Associativity (Left-to-right in python)
# when two operators have same precedence, then associativity helps us to determine the order of operations. Almost all the operators have left to right associativity.


# print(5 * 2 // 3 )

# print(5 // 2 * 3 )

# Exponent operator has right to left associativity
# print(  2 ** 3 ** 1) => (2 ** 3)


#  x == y
#  x != y
#  x < y
#  x > y
#  x <= y
#  x >= y

# widely used in if-else conditions and loops

# we start a if condition by writing if keyword


# x = 20
# y = 30

# if x > y:
#     print('y is greater than x')


# collegeTime = 10

# personEnteringCollege = 15

# if personEnteringCollege < collegeTime:
#     print('Go to college')
# else :
#     print('Go back to hostel')


# if (2 > 5):
#     print('hello')
# else:
#     print('bye')
 
 
# if 10 > 5: print('Ten is greater than five') #One liner if condition

# print('hello') if 5 > 5 else print('bye') #one liner for if-else
